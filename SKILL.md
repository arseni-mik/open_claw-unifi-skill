# UniFi Network Advisor

Read-only skill covering two official UniFi API surfaces. All operations are GET-only — no writes, no mutations of any kind.

## API surfaces

Everything goes through `https://api.ui.com`. No direct local connection required.

| Prefix | Surface | Proxied via | Env vars needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| SM | Site Manager | `api.ui.com/v1/...` | `UNIFI_API_KEY` |
| NET | Network Integration | `api.ui.com/v1/connector/consoles/{hostId}/proxy/network/integration/v1/...` | `UNIFI_API_KEY` (host/site resolved automatically) |

## How to call the script

```
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unifi.py <subcommand> [--site SITE] [--id ID] [--limit N] [--next-token TOKEN] [subcommand-specific flags]
```

Some subcommands require additional flags — see the table below. Use `python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unifi.py list` to see all subcommands with descriptions.

## Examples

```bash
# List all sites and pick one to work with
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unifi.py library

# firewall-ordering: get zone IDs first, then query ordering between two of them
# --from-zone and --to-zone must be real UUIDs from the firewall-zones output
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unifi.py firewall-zones --site hq
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unifi.py firewall-ordering --site hq --from-zone <zoneId> --to-zone <zoneId>

# network-refs: get network list first, then query references for a specific network
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unifi.py networks --site hq
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unifi.py network-refs --site hq --id <networkId>

# sdwan-config / sdwan-status: list configs first to get an ID
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unifi.py sdwan
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unifi.py sdwan-config --id <configId>
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unifi.py sdwan-status --id <configId>
```

## Site library

On every invocation the skill builds a site library by joining:
- `GET /v1/hosts` — host names (user-set), hardware model, connection state, `apiIntegration` flag
- `GET /v1/sites` — `siteId` per `hostId`

Labels come directly from the name the user set in the UniFi UI — e.g. "HQ" → `hq`, "Branch Office" → `branch-office`, "Remote Site" → `remote-site`. The library is cached in `~/.openclaw/unifi-skill.json` for 15 minutes to avoid redundant API calls.

Hosts without Network API support (e.g. a NAS device with `apiIntegration: false`) are included in the library but will return a clear error if targeted with NET subcommands.

Run `library` to see the current library including state, hardware, and API capability of each host.

## Site selection

All NET subcommands accept `--site <hint>`. The hint is matched against label, name, hardware shortname, hardware name, timezone, and IP — partial matches work.

| User says | Use |
|---|---|
| "the main office network" | `--site hq` |
| "remote site firewall" | `--site remote-site` |
| "the branch office" | `--site branch-office` |
| "the Dream Machine Pro" | `--site udmpro` |
| "the warehouse AP" | `--site warehouse` |

If `--site` is omitted the first entry in the library is used. If the hint is ambiguous the skill lists the matching labels and asks for a more specific hint.

**Always specify `--site` when the user mentions a location or device.** When the user says "my network" without specifying, run `library` first to show what sites are available and ask which one they mean.

## How to give advice

### Devices (`devices`, `device`)
- `status != "online"` → offline or disconnected — surface to user
- `firmwareStatus: "updateAvailable"` → firmware update pending
- `device-stats` → CPU/memory/uptime signals for performance issues

### Clients (`clients`, `client`)
- High noise or weak signal → coverage gap, suggest AP placement review
- Unexpected clients on sensitive VLANs → flag for review

### Firewall (`firewall-policies`, `firewall-zones`, `acl-rules`)
- Policies allowing all traffic between sensitive zones → flag as overly broad
- Cross-zone allow rules → confirm intentional with user
- Check `firewall-ordering` — rules are evaluated in order; misplaced rules cause unexpected behaviour

### DNS (`dns-policies`)
- Custom DNS policies can bypass filtering — flag any unexpected overrides

### VPN (`vpn-tunnels`, `vpn-servers`)
- Tunnel state down → connectivity issue to surface
- Verify expected peers are configured

### ISP metrics (`isp-metrics`)
- Packet loss > 1% or latency spikes → WAN quality issue, advise checking with ISP

## Notes

- `network-refs` requires `--id` (a network ID). Only networks with active references (devices, clients, or WiFi assigned to them) return data — unused networks return a handled error: `"Network '...' has no active references"`. Run `networks` first to list all networks, then pass the ID of one that carries traffic.
- `firewall-ordering` requires both `--from-zone` and `--to-zone`. Run `firewall-zones` first to list zone IDs. The API returns the ordered policy IDs for traffic flowing from the source zone to the destination zone.
- `sdwan-config` and `sdwan-status` require `--id`. Run `sdwan` first to list configs and get an ID. These return empty on accounts without SD-WAN configured.

## Source & contributing

Source code, issue tracker, and contributions: [github.com/arseni-mik/open_claw-unifi-skill](https://github.com/arseni-mik/open_claw-unifi-skill/tree/main)

This same repository also ships an MCP server (`unifi-mcp`) covering the same data, for use with Claude Code, OpenClaw, or any other MCP client — see the README's "MCP Server" section. The two are independent; this skill's behavior is unaffected either way.

## Constraints

- All operations are GET-only. Never suggest using this skill to make changes.
- Guide the user to make changes in the UniFi dashboard or mobile app.
- Do not expose raw API keys in responses.
